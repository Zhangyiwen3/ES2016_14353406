A1: 0~1.155v  
A2: 2.145~5V  
A3: Positive: The true state has higher voltage than the false state. Negative: The true state has lower voltage than the false state.  
A4: A positive voltage from source to gate.  
A5: A postive voltage from gate to source.  
A6: Volatile memory loses its information whne power is removed and then restored. Nonvolatile memory retains its information when power is removed and then restored.  
A7: Flash is a type of EEPROM.  
A8: The TM4C123 has 32 kibibytes of RAM and 256 kibibytes of ROM.  
A13: A flowchart is a graphical way to describe software algorithm, showing the steps and the sequence among the steps.  
A14: A data flow graph is a block diagram of the system, showing the flow of informatin. Arrows point from source to destination.  
A15: A call graph is a graphical way to describe how software/hardware modules interconnect.  
A17:A von Neumann architecture has only one bus for data and instruction. Harvard architecture has two separate busses.
